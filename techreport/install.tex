\section{Obtaining the $\pvslm$ Implementation}
\label{sec.install}

The $\pvslm$ tool can be installed automatically from the terminal in
*nix systems by issuing the following command:
%
{\small
\begin{lstlisting}
$ curl http://migueleci.github.io/pvslm/downloads/pvslm-conf.py \
    -o pvslm-install && chmod +x pvslm-install && \
    python ./pvslm-install
\end{lstlisting}
}
%
This command uses the $\curl$ utility to download the $\pvslm$
installation sources from GitHub. Once these sources are downloaded
and some file permissions adjusted, the installation script is
executed as a Python 2 program. During the installation process, the
user can select the value for global variable \cde{PVS\_PATH}, i.e.,
the location in which the tool is to be installed, including where the
configuration files for the library sources and the local copy of the
libraries are to be placed. This procedure and the installation script
have been tested both on Linux and Mac OS X boxes.

Upon its successful installation, $\pvslm$ automatically configures
the NASALib library sources and makes a local copy of them by using
{\em git}'s clone command, so they are available for installation in
PVS.  Further information on the installation procedure is available
from~\cite{pvslm} including, e.g., a detailed list of the tool
commands and some examples of the configuration files.
