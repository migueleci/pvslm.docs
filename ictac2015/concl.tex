\section{Concluding Remarks}
\label{sec.concl}

This paper has presented the $\pvslm$ tool for managing libaries for
the Prototype Verification System (PVS). This tool features support
for different library sources, libraries with several theories, and
dependencies theories (withing the same library source).  The tool is
freely available for download and it is distributed under GNU's GPLv3
license. The tool uses a small footprint language for annotating
libraries, which is described in full detail in BNF-like notation in
this paper. This paper also includes all commands available from the
tool, its architecture, and an overview of its installation process.
A detailed step-by-step case study is included illustrating the use of
some of the tool's commands.

As usual, much work remains to be done. First, it is important to make
available other library sources through the $\pvslm$ tool.  Also, it
is important to stress the tool against different servers and withing
more operating systems. Finally, it would be highly desirable for the
tool to be able to manage different versions of a library source, also
depending on the installed versions of PVS in the host system. This
will require a new description language for annotating library
sources.
