The Prototype Verification System (PVS) is a successful specification
language with support tools and an automated theorem prover that is
being used globally by the formal methods community. This paper
presents $\pvslm$, a tool for managing PVS libraries featuring support
for different library sources, libraries with several theories, and
dependencies among libraries and theories (even from different library
sources). The tool, freely available for download, is a command line
application written in the Python programming language and depends,
mainly, on the distributed revision control system Git. This paper
presents the main features of $\pvslm$ and a description language for
annotating libraries so that they can be shared with the tool.  This
paper also includes a detailed step-by-step guide on how to use
$\pvslm$ for the configuration of the current version of the NASA PVS
Library, available at GitHub.
