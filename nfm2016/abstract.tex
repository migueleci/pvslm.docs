  The Prototype Verification System (PVS) is a specification language
  integrated with support tools and a theorem prover. One mechanism
  for extending and improving PVS is through the development of
  libraries, i.e., collections of mechanized theories in the language
  of PVS. This paper presents the $\pvslm$ tool: (i) a description
  language for annotating PVS libraries, expressive enough for
  describing complex dependencies among library theories; and (ii) an
  implementation for managing PVS libraries annotated with this
  language, offering support for several library sources.  The
  usefulness of the tool is illustrated in this paper with a detailed
  step-by-step guide on how to manage the current version of the NASA
  PVS Library with both $\pvslm$'s annotation language and
  implementation.
