  The Prototype Verification System (PVS) is a specification language
  integrated with support tools and a theorem prover. One mechanism
  for extending and improving PVS is via the development of libraries,
  i.e., collections of mechanized theories in the language of
  PVS. This paper presents the $\pvslm$ tool: (i) a description
  language for annotating PVS libraries, with a small footprint but
  expressive enough for describing dependencies among library
  theories; and (ii) an implementation for managing PVS libraries
  annotated with this language, offering support for several library
  sources.  The usefulness of the $\pvslm$ tool is illustrated with a
  detailed step-by-step guide on how to manage the latest version of
  the NASA PVS Library, which is currently annotated with $\pvslm$'s
  description language.
