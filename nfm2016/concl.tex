\section{Concluding Remarks}
\label{sec.concl}

This paper presented the $\pvslm$ tool for library management for the
Prototype Verification System (PVS), comprising both a description
language and an implementation. The $\pvslm$ description language is a
small footprint language for annotating libraries with its theory
contents and their dependencies, and was presented in the paper with
full detail in BNF-like notation. The $\pvslm$ implementation features
support for managing several library sources available online and it
is freely available under GNU's GPLv3 license.  This paper presented
an overview of the tool's installation process and a detailed
step-by-step case study illustrating the tool's main features while
managing the latest release of the NASA PVS Library (NASALib).

As usual, work remains to be done. For instance, it is key to make
available other PVS library sources with the help of the $\pvslm$
tool. Also, it would be highly desirable for the tool to manage
several versions of a library source, each configured to work with
different versions of PVS.
