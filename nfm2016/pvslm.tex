\section{$\pvslm$ Practical Value}
\label{sec.pvslm}

This section describe the advantages of using $\pvslm$, 
and its relevance for the PVS users.

Currently PVS users have to download the libraries 
and configure them manually, i.e. they have to get a local 
copy of the entire repository ($\git$) and then move the 
sources to the PVS\_PATH, every time the need to use 
a new library or update an old one. $\pvslm$ gives the 
advantage of managing several libraries (installing, 
updating or deleting) through the command line. 

The ease of installing and keeping the packages up-to-date 
is the practical value of the tool. Since, once a library is 
configured, just a single command is needed to both update
and configure the package and all their dependencies.
