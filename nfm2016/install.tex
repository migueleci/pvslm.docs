\section{Installation}
\label{sec.install}

This section presents an overview of the installation procedure.

The $\pvslm$ tool can be installed automatically from the command line
by issuing the following command:
%
\begin{verbatim}
  curl http://migueleci.github.io/pvslm/downloads/pvslm-conf.py \
    -o pvslm-install && chmod +x pvslm-install && \
    python ./pvslm-install
\end{verbatim}
%
This command uses the $\curl$ utility to download the $\pvslm$
installation sources from GitHub. Once these sources are downloaded
and some file permissions adjusted, the installation process is
executed as a Python 2 script. During the installation process, the
user can select the location in which the tool is to be installed,
including where the configuration files for the library sources and
the local copy of the libraries are to be placed. This script has been
tested both on Linux and Mac OS X boxes. 

Upon its successful installation, $\pvslm$ automatically configures
the NASALib library sources and makes a local copy of them by using
Git's clone command, so they are available for installation in PVS.

Further information of $\pvslm$ is available on~\cite{pvslm}, e.g. a 
detailed list of the tool commands and some examples of the configuration
files.
