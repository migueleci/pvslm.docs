\section{Obtaining the $\pvslm$ Implementation}
\label{sec.install}

The $\pvslm$ tool can be installed automatically from the terminal in
*nix systems by issuing the following command:
%
{\small\begin{verbatim}
  curl http://migueleci.github.io/pvslm/downloads/pvslm-conf.py \
    -o pvslm-install && chmod +x pvslm-install && \
    python ./pvslm-install
\end{verbatim}}
%
This command uses the $\curl$ utility to download the $\pvslm$
installation script. Once downloaded, the installation script is
executed as a Python 2 program.  During the installation process, the
user can select the value for global variable \cde{PVS\_PATH}, i.e.,
the location in which the tool is to be installed, including where the
configuration files for the library sources and the local copy of the
libraries are to be placed. This procedure and the installation script
have been tested both on Linux and Mac OS X boxes. It is important to
note that the installation script, as it is also the case for the
$\pvslm$ implementation, relies on the $\git$ utility --a free, open,
and popular source distributed version control system--.

Upon its successful installation, the $\pvslm$ installation script
automatically configures the NASALib library sources and makes a local
copy of the entire library, so that they are immediately available for
installation in PVS.  Further information on the installation
procedure is available from~\cite{pvslm}, including a detailed list of
the tool commands and some examples of configuration files.
