\section{Introduction}

The Prototype Verification System~\cite{pvs-cade92} (PVS) is a
verification system comprising a specification language integrated
with support tools and a theorem prover; basically, PVS is a
mechanization of classical typed higher-order logic with
specifications organized into parameterized theories in this logic.
The PVS system has been used in state-of-the-art formal methods
projects as a productive environment for constructing and maintaining
collections of theories, both in industry and in research. These novel
developments often result in large collections of PVS definitions,
theorems, and proofs, grouped into libraries, with many dependencies
among them. This is the case, for instance, of the NASA PVS
Library~\cite{nasalib} maintained by the NASA Langley Formal Methods
Team: a large collection of freely-available formal developments in
PVS comprising more than 40 theories and xx theorems, ranging from
trigonometry to graphs and topology.
